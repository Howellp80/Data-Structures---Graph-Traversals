Using a provided circularly linked-list deque (deque.c) I implemented Both a Depth First Search and a Breadth First Search graph traversal. Additionally I created a DFS recursive graph traversal. Each of these implementations are located in graph.c

Usage:
To run copy the provided files into your directory and type:
$ make all
$ prog 

To run tests, type:
$ tests

To clean up, type:
$ make clean
